        <p>We at Function Earth (“Function Earth,”, "FE", “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Function Earth in connection with our website located at www.functionearth.com (the “Site”), and the Service.</p>
        <p>By visiting our Site and/or using our Service, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>
        <h4 class="help-question">Information We Collect</h4>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
        <p>When you sign up to become a Registered User, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, birth date (“Personal Information”). If you choose to purchase Products through the Service, you will be asked to provide your billing address, shipping address and credit card information (“Transaction Information”).</p>
        <p>Like most web sites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit our Site to record information that identifies your computer, to track your use of our Site, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits. This information includes information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Service (the “Usage Information”).</p>
        <p>We may collect this Usage Information by using cookies and pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs). Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web site users. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Service.</p>
        <p>We do not collect personally identifying information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with personally identifying information we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
        <p>We may also allow third-party companies that are presenting advertisements on the Site to set and access their own cookies. Such third-party cookies are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but by the privacy policies of such third party.</p>
        <h4 class="help-question">Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Companies</h4>
        <p>We may share Usage Information about your activity on the Site with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Site, and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Usage Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us and these third-parties to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.</p>
        <p>We may share your Personal Information, and non-personal information, including your name, address, email address and any transactions you conduct on our Site or offline with us with a third party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver tailored advertising to you that match your interests when you visit our Site as well as other websites.
